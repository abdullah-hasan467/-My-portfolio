            <br>

            In addition to my academic and professional endeavors, I am an avid sports enthusiast. I derive immense pleasure from playing cricket, football, and volleyball. My proficiency in fast bowling in cricket, adept defensive skills in football, and agile gameplay in volleyball reflect my dedication to athletic pursuits.

            Beyond my academic and athletic interests, I am also a lover of literature. I find solace in the verses of poetry, both as a reader and a writer. Crafting sonnets and verses allows me to express my thoughts and emotions in a profound manner, often drawing inspiration from the beauty of nature and the intricacies of human.
